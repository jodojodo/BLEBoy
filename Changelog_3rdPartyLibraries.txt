Bluefruit52Lib Changes
(https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_nRF52_Arduino)
=====
Most changes apply to only Bluefruit.h and Bluefruit.cpp. Some changes to BLECharacterisitc.h and BLECharacteristic.cpp

- Support for Security Mode 1 Level 4 characteristics.
- Support for legacy passkey entry and OOB.
- Support for LE Secure Connections (all association models).
  - Requires use of micro-ecc library to handle DHE operations.
- Support for device bonding, bond storage, and loading previous bonded connections.
- Added utility functions for retrieving connection security, device address, and other device/connection properties.
- Added functionality to set peripheral GAP security parameters.
- Disabled DFU OTA service to prevent any unexpected behavior if malformed data is written to the service. Based on the service's default configuration,
the service is available to any device that can connect to the peripheral. See line 331 of bluefruit.cpp for the change.

NOTE: These changes are not intended for use in secure systems. The library was modified to allow testing of all BLE pairing methods.



arduino-menusystem Changes
(https://github.com/jonblack/arduino-menusystem)
===
Changes only apply to MenuSystem.cpp and MenuSystem.h

  - Modified to include a new menu item type (ConfigMenuItem).


micro-ecc
(https://github.com/kmackay/micro-ecc)
===

Changes only apply to uECC.h. The following lines have been added to ensure support for the ECDH curve needed for BLE LESC pairing
and changing endianess to work with nRF52 Feather:

> #define uECC_VLI_NATIVE_LITTLE_ENDIAN 1
> #define uECC_SUPPORT_COMPRESSED_POINT 0
> #define uECC_SUPPORTS_secp256r1 1
> #define uECC_SQUARE_FUNC 1
> #define uECC_OPTIMIZATION_LEVEL 3
> #define uECC_ENABLE_VLI_API 1
